# Phoenix Languageüê¶

## What is this?

Phoenix is the birth of a new language. It is a language that is designed to be simply like python, yet as powerful as C. 
Phoenix will support static typing, functions, and more.

## Why?

Why not? I'm simply interested in how programming languages work on the inside.
I also realized, that doing this in typescript was not a good idea, so I switched to
go lang about midway through the project.

## Performance
