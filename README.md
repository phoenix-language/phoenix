# Phoenix Language🐦

# Warning ⚠️

Phoenix is not ready for production in any way and is still under heavy development. 
The API is subject to change without notice. Use at your own risk.

## What is this?

Phoenix is a [Concurrent language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)), [Garbage collected languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) for [Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).

## Why?

Why not? I'm simply interested in how programming languages work on the inside.
I also realized, that doing this in typescript was not a good idea, so I switched to
[golang](https://go.dev/) about midway through the project.

## Language example

**Basic Example** - All of these a subject to change and still under thought
```phx
// console output is declared using the 'terminal' key word.

// Variable declaration

declare Foo = Bar

// function declaration

phunc Foo (params type) returnType -> (
    declare bar = "foobar"
    return bar
)

// Logical operators

terminal true || false
terminal false && true

// control flow

if [condition] (
    "yes please"
) else (
    terminal "no thanks"
)

// For loops

for [declare i = 1; i < 5; i++] (
    terminal i
)

// while loop

while [true] (
    terminal true
)

```

## Performance ⚡

## TODO list 📃

## Developers

To create a development environment to build Phoenix you need a few tools.
