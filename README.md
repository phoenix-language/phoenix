# Phoenix Language🐦

# Warning

Phoenix is not ready for production in any way and is still under heavy development. 
The API is subject to change without notice. Use at your own risk.

## What is this?

Phoenix is a [Concurrent language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)), [Garbage collected languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) for [Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).

## Why?

Why not? I'm simply interested in how programming languages work on the inside.
I also realized, that doing this in typescript was not a good idea, so I switched to
go lang about midway through the project.

## Performance

soon...

## TODO list

A list of current mandatory things I need to get done for the language to work.



## Developers

To create a development environment to build Phoenix you need a few tools.

**Coming soon**
