# Phoenix Language🐦

# Warning ⚠️

Phoenix is not ready for production in any way and is still under heavy development. 
The API is subject to change without notice. Use at your own risk.

## What is this?

Phoenix is a [Concurrent language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)), 
[Garbage collected languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) for [Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).
Currently, bootstrapped with go. 

## Why?

Why not? I'm simply interested in how programming languages work on the inside.
I also realized, that doing this in typescript was not a good idea, so I switched to
[golang](https://go.dev/) about midway through the project.
