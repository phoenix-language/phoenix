# Best-of-N Problem Solving

Use this skill when facing a hard problem with multiple possible approaches — complex refactors, tricky bugs, performance optimization, or architectural decisions where you're not sure which strategy will work best.

## How It Works

Cursor's `best-of-n-runner` subagent type creates isolated git worktrees — each attempt gets its own branch and working directory. Multiple approaches run in parallel without interfering with each other. You compare the results and pick the winner.

## Steps

1. **Identify the approaches** — before launching, define 2-3 distinct strategies. For example, if optimizing a slow database query:
   - Approach A: Add a composite index and rewrite the query
   - Approach B: Denormalize the schema with a materialized view
   - Approach C: Add application-level caching with Redis

2. **Launch parallel runners** — use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "best-of-n-runner"` for each approach. Launch them all in a single message so they run concurrently:

   ```
   Task 1: { subagent_type: "best-of-n-runner", prompt: "Approach A: ..." }
   Task 2: { subagent_type: "best-of-n-runner", prompt: "Approach B: ..." }
   Task 3: { subagent_type: "best-of-n-runner", prompt: "Approach C: ..." }
   ```

   Each runner gets its own branch and worktree. Include clear success criteria in the prompt (e.g., "run the tests and report if they pass", "measure the query time").

3. **Compare results** — when all runners complete, evaluate:
   - Which approach passes all tests?
   - Which has the cleanest implementation?
   - Which has the best performance characteristics?
   - Which is easiest to maintain long-term?

4. **Merge the winner** — check out the winning branch and merge it, or cherry-pick specific commits. Clean up the other worktree branches.

## When to Use This

- A bug that could have multiple root causes
- A refactor where you're choosing between patterns (e.g., composition vs. inheritance)
- Performance optimization with multiple strategies
- Trying different libraries or approaches for the same feature
- Any situation where "just try it" is faster than analyzing

## Notes

- Each runner is fully isolated — they can't see each other's changes.
- Keep prompts specific: include the file paths, the problem statement, and clear success criteria.
- For simpler problems, this is overkill — just use a single agent.
- The branches are real git branches, so you can inspect them manually if needed.
